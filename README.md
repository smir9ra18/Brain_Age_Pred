# Brain Age Prediction — Mini Neuro-AI Project

**Purpose:** Small, focused project demonstrating brain-age estimation using MRI-derived features. This repo showcases data simulation, exploratory analysis, and modeling using Linear Regression and Random Forest in an industry-friendly, concise format with academic context.

**Contents**
- `Brain_Age_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full code, analysis, and plots.
- `data/` — synthetic dataset (generated inside the notebook).
- `results/` — output figures (saved by notebook when run).

**Key features**
- Synthetic MRI-derived features (cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, white/grey matter volumes, intracranial volume).
- Demonstrates preprocessing, model training, evaluation (RMSE, R²), and feature importance analysis.
- Clean visuals suitable for portfolio demonstration and discussion during interviews.

**Tech stack**
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, joblib

**How to run**
1. Open `Brain_Age_Prediction.ipynb` in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run cells sequentially. The notebook will generate synthetic data and save figures in the `results/` folder.
3. Review `results/` for saved plots and `data/` for saved CSV (if exported).

**Notes**
- Data is synthetic and designed to mimic realistic MRI-derived features for educational/demo purposes.
- This project is intended to show familiarity with neuro-AI concepts and practical data-science workflow.
